# Hypercomplex-Valued Convolutional Neural Networks

Hypercomplex numbers generalize the notion of complex and hyperbolic numbers as well as quaternions, tessarines, octonions, and many other high-dimensional algebras including Clifford and Cayley-Dickson algebras. This repository contains the source codes and examples of hypercomplex-valued convolutional neural networks (HvCNNs), which include quaternionic models as particular instances.

See examples in the following Jupyter notebook files:

### *Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Detection Using Hypercomplex-Valued Convolutional Neural Networks* 
This Jupyter notebook contains the hypercomplex-valued convolutional neural networks used for acute lymphoblastic leukemia detection, as described in the paper with the same title by Marcos Eduardo Valle and Guilherme Vieira accepted for presentation at the 2022 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN 2022), as part of the World Congress on Computational Intelligence (WCCI 2022). The notebook uses the ALL-IDB2 dataset, a public and free dataset of microscopic images of blood samples designed for the evaluation and the comparison of algorithms for segmentation and image classification. Further information on the ALL-IDB dataset can be found at https://homes.di.unimi.it/scotti/all/
