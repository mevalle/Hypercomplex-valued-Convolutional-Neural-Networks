# Hypercomplex-Valued Convolutional Neural Networks

Hypercomplex numbers generalize the notion of complex and hyperbolic numbers as well as quaternions, tessarines, octonions, and many other high-dimensional algebras including Clifford and Cayley-Dickson algebras. 
This repository contains the source-codes and examples of hypercomplex-valued convolutional neural networks (HvCNNs), which include quaternionic models as particular instances.

See examples in the Jupyter notebook files.
